# GoodBites

Welcome, this is an old reference project of mine.

It took me about 4 months to put this together. This is not much of a development repository, more of an archive of everything I did to put this project together.

This was my first sizable project in Pascal _Delphi_ so I am pretty proud of what I was able to do, it was also a great learning point for me at the time.
It taught me a whole lot about things in programming that have affected my programming style today.

I hope this can be a useful reference for anyone who hopes to use it to learn anything
or just to look at the old code I wrote when I barely knew what a compiler was.

Anyway, thanks for reading!
